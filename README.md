# Home Intruder Detection System

This repository contains the entire hardware setup and code in a presentable format for the prototype built during the **Bid 2 Build** competition which secured our team the 2nd place.

## Overview
- **Bid 2 Build** was a competition conducted by Potential - Robotics Club of SNUC which involved bidding on components with the limited credits available and making the best use of the components secured by bidding in a limited time frame.
- With the components secured by our team, we were able to build a low-power Home Intruder Detection system.
- The prototype involved the use of ESP32 microcontroller, PIR Sensor, Photoresistor Sensor and a buzzer for alert
